# Burp
When it comes to securing web applications, especially those with user-facing interfaces, understanding the techniques attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities is essential. Burp Suite is one of the most powerful tools for identifying and exploiting web application weaknesses. It acts as both a proxy for intercepting HTTP/S traffic and a vulnerability scanner, enabling security researchers and developers to find flaws before malicious actors do.

In this mini-series, we will explore how to use Burp Suite and related tools to detect and exploit common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and file upload manipulation. By understanding these attack vectors, security professionals can fortify web applications and reduce the risk of breaches.
